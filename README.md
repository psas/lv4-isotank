# lv4-isotank
Repo for the LV4 "isotank" fuel tank project

# Isotank Overview
The goal of the LV4 Isotank project is a light-weight, easily manufacturable liquid oxygen (LOX) tank. Thin-wall aluminum monocoque tanks require specialty welding services and composite tanks are at a low technical readiness level (TRL). The isotank will be constructed from a thick walled pipe that will have an isogrid pattern machined onto the outer surface. The tube will have an isogrid pattern machined into the bulk of the tube, but the ends will be left thick to allow the end cap to be welded in place.

## Isogrid Resources
Isogrid was developed in the late 60s/early 70s by NASA and it's contractors. For more details, see [NASA CR-124075 Isogrid Design Handbook](https://femci.gsfc.nasa.gov/isogrid/NASA-CR-124075_Isogrid_Design.pdf)

# Pathfinder Tank
This tank will be manufactured at LV3.1 scale (6" ID) and used to test the manufacturing process.
